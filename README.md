# Simple Reactive Robot

## Context

This project consists on the second milestone for the subject of Robotics. The main goals are the familiarization with
robotics and, in our case, the V-REP platform. Secondly, to find and use the most interesting agent architecture for
the development of a wall-following agent, acknowledge it's benefits and limitations by trying to follow walls.

The first step was to have the robot follow a wall on his side indefinitely, and to do so we had to first get the information from the robot's sensors, then by the information it gives us adjust the distance to the wall by adjusting the speed on the left and right wheels independently.
